## How to Use

### Step 1: Initialize the Logger

To start using Marco's Logger, you need to initialize it with your preferred settings. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```javascript
const logger = require('marcos-logger');

logger.init({
    path: '.',                // Path for saving the log files
    level_error: true,        // Create a separate file for error logs
    level_warning: true,      // Create a separate file for warning logs
    daily: true               // Log files are dated daily
});
```

### Parameters:

- **path**: The directory where log files will be saved. Example: `path: './logs'`.
- **level_error**: Boolean flag to create a separate file for error logs. Example: `level_error: true`.
- **level_warning**: Boolean flag to create a separate file for warning logs. Example: `level_warning: true`.
- **daily**: Boolean flag to create daily dated log files. Example: `daily: true`.

### Step 2: Logging Messages

After initialization, you can log messages at various levels:

```javascript
logger.info('This is an informational message.');
logger.warn('This is a warning message.');
logger.error('This is an error message.');
```

### Step 3: Timing Operations

You can also create labeled timers to measure the duration of operations. The timer logs the start and end times:

```javascript
logger.time('operation');
// Your code here
logger.timeEnd('operation');
```

### Example Usage:

```javascript
// Import the logger
const logger = require('marcos-logger');

// Initialize the logger with configuration
logger.init({
    path: './logs',
    level_error: true,
    level_warning: true,
    daily: true
});

// Log some messages
logger.info('Application started.');
logger.warn('This is a warning message.');
logger.error('An error occurred.');

// Measure the time taken for an operation
logger.time('database_query');
// Simulate a database query
setTimeout(() => {
    logger.timeEnd('database_query');
}, 2000);
```
